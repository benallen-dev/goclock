# GoClock

It's a clock. In the terminal. Written in Go.

That's all it is really, sometimes you just have a little spot left in your sick terminal setup and it's the perfect place for a clock. This program fills that literal niche.

Or at least it will for 5 seconds because right now it just quits after that.
